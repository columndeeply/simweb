# About _simweb_
_simweb_ is a simple WebView app with JS support and navigation history.

# Usage
First you'll need to change the URL the app will open. To do so go to the `MainActivity.kt` and change the "https://example.org" on line 27.

If you want to change the app icon you can do so using Android Studio's built in process (google it).

Once the URL has been changed build the app and it's ready to go
